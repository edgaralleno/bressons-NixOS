# bressons-NixOS
a repository for my nix config for troubleshooting

Next goals â€”
    1. Complete the breaking up of my hyprland config.
    2. Consider similar structuring for other known config types, like
       waybar.
    3. Definitely restructure my config.nix. That thing is a bitch.
    4. Learn flakes? and probably home manager. It might help me with
       setting something up for Madeline in the future.
    5. Complete the automation of theme changes.
